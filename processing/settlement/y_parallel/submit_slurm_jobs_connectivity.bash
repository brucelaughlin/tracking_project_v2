# Now trying to parallelize connectivityHist calculations.  My connectivityHist calculation is actually just a 2D histogram builder,
# with normalization happening later in a plotting script.  So, can just compute a bunch of histograms for various sets of
# tracking files and then combine them.

# Note: Many thanks to The Paul for his counsel, which led to the switch towards a config-file appraoch.  The serialization
# described and implemented below was also his idea, and serialSize as a ceil calculation was his doing.

# Say we have 8 config files (ie 8 slurm calls, ie 8 nodes' worth of work), and 3 nodes to work with.  We run in a serial way, so that
# file 2 starts as soon as file 1 finishes, file 5 starts as soon as file 4 finishes, etc.  Looks like this:
# 1 -> 2 -> 3
# 4 -> 5 -> 6
# 7 -> 8
# Note that Paul re-configured his version of this so that 1,2,3 are running together, and 1->4->7 is a serial chain (so that if
# a job is killed, completed files are in the expected order rather than being "shuffled" by the more primitive serial algorithm.

# <serialSize> is the maximum chain length in the above diagram.  It's equal to np.ceil(<numConnJobFiles>,<numNodes>), but we need to code
# our own version of "ceil" using bash's integer division, which is floor division (ie 9/10 = 0 in bash).
